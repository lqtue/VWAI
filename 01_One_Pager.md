# VWAI: AI-Assisted Search & Rescue of Martyrs' Remains

**Tech Team Proposal — February 2026**

---

## The Problem

- **300,000** Vietnamese soldiers remain missing
- **261,000 CDEC files** (2.7M pages) at TTU — largest collection worldwide
- At current manual pace: **15-20 years** to process
- Families waiting for closure cannot wait that long

---

## The Solution: 4-Layer System

```
Layer 1: DIGITIZE     AI reads documents → Humans verify
Layer 2: CONNECT      Link Person ↔ Unit ↔ Event ↔ Place
Layer 3: PREDICT      Calculate probability → Generate heatmap
Layer 4: SEARCH       Field teams dig prioritized zones
```

**Pilot focus:** Prove Layers 1-2 work. Layers 3-4 follow in Year 2.
